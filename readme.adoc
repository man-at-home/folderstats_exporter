A https://prometheus.io/[prometheus.io] exporter for directory contents. I'm not a Go developer so PRs are definitely welcome.

== Metrics

The following metrics for a monitored directory path are currently exposed:

* _folderstats_files_created_  monitored file creation events in path counter
* _folderstats_files_modified_ monitored file modification events in path counter
* _folderstats_files_deleted_  monitored file deletion (or moved out of path) events counter
* _folderstats_files_in_path_  (up to a limit of 1024) current children in path gauge
